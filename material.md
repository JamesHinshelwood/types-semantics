## What we expect from you – as you present a paper

The goal of the reading sessions is to practice with reading, presenting, and analysing research papers. 

If you are responsible for presenting a paper, we expect the following:

* You should read the paper carefully in advance;

* You should be able to sketch the academic context of this paper. When was it written? What work does it cite? What later work cites this paper? What other work did it build upon? What was its research impact?

* At the beginning of the session, you should briefly introduce the paper in 5-10 minutes. What is the paper about? What are the main results?

* After this introduction, you should informally guide us through the paper explaining the details step by step. You should pay particular attention to interesting, relevant, questionable, or difficult parts (25 minutes).

* As we read the paper, you should be able to answer any questions from the audience. 

* You are responsible for ensuring that we have completed the paper in the available time (35 to 40 minutes), leaving time for further questions.

* You should chair the discussion about the paper, and try to actively engage your fellow students by posing questions, making claims, suggesting alternative solutions, etc.

* At the end of the session, you should be able to make an informed conclusion about the research results and share this with the class.

Your presentation will be judged using the following criteria:

* Did you clearly present the essence of the problem discussed in the paper, its solution, and its context/impact?
* Did you analyse the problem, its solution, and its context/impact thoroughly?
* Did you involve the class in reading the paper?
* Did you manage time well (in particular: did you manage to read the paper in 45 minutes)?


## What we expect from you – if you attend the reading sessions

* You have read the paper and understand what it is about.

* You have formulated careful questions about any technical issues that you did not understand.

* You actively engage in the discussion about the paper, asking the presentors questions or challenging their interpretation of the work.

* Don't just sit back and let it wash over you – this is an opportunity to learn a great deal!
