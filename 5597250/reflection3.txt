To grade the type and effect systems submission, use the following:

(i)   3.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(ii)  2   points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(iii) 2.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(iv)  1   point or less
   
Score for:
(i)        : 2.0
Unfortunately, I did not solve the constraints complelety. Also, I forgot to add the type rules.
(ii)       : 2.0
From my understanding how it should work, it works. So 2 points
(iii)      : 2.5
From my understanding how it should work, it works. So 2.5 points
(iv)       : 0.0
Did implement this part
Readability: 0.75
I think it is readeble, because I splitted the file into several parts. However, there is still room for some improvement. So I gave for this part 0.75.
