To grade the type and effect systems submission, use the following:

(i)   3.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
    -- (0.5) Examples cover the basics
    -- (0.4) Documentation for base analysis is ok
    -- (2.5) The base CFA should be implemented correctly and is working on the provided examples

(ii)  2   points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
  -- (0.5) Examples cover different cases
  -- (0.4) Rules are provided, some explanation in the docs could have been helpful
  -- (1) Pairs are dealt with correctly.

(iii) 2.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
  -- (0.5) Examples cover different cases
  -- (0.4) Rules are provided, some explanation in the docs could have been helpful
  -- (1.2) Some poisoning is still present for lists. There is also a bug in 
  dealing with the tail of a list  

(iv)  1   point or less
  -- (0.8) Rules are provided, some explanation in the docs could have been helpful

   
General readability of the pdf and the code: 1 point or less
  -- (0.2) The code is not sufficiently commented or is implemented in a 
  concise way. The pdf is very short and just provides the basic rules
  with no added comments.  

Issues to think of: 
  * do examples cover important cases, like list of functions, functions on
    pairs?
  * is subeffecting done in a way that tries to prevent poisoning? You can
    usually tell from the unification rule for functions (equating the
    annotation variables in that case usually means that active measures
    against poisoning were not taken).
  * Is the flow of the case statements done well?
  * does the documentation provide the necessary type rules and explanations
  * maybe it goes without saying, but if some part is partially answered,
    you should estimate the percentage that was done correctly.
    
Bonuspoint: 
  - is there a polyvariant implementation?
  - if yes, give up to one point (dont forget to run it on examples where it 
    makes a difference)
