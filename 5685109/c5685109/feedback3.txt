To grade the type and effect systems submission, use the following:

(i)   3.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
-- (0.5) Examples look fine
-- (0.5) Not sure what docs there are to grade
-- (2.2) In a few cases there are unification errors

(ii)  2   points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
-- (0.5) Examples look fine
-- (0.3) Formal typing rules are given, but there is no explanation
-- (1.0) Works fine

(iii) 2.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
-- (0.5) Examples look fine
-- (0.3) Formal typing rules are given, but there is no explanation
-- (1.2) Poisoning has not been solved for lists
(iv)  1   point or less
-- (0.1) Typing rule has been given
-- No code has been implemented
   
General readability of the pdf and the code: 1 point or less
-- (0.5) Code contains no comments, which made it quite difficult to understand what is going on. Furthermore,
         there was little documentation for lists and pairs.

Issues to think of: 
  * do examples cover important cases, like list of functions, functions on
    pairs?
  * is subeffecting done in a way that tries to prevent poisoning? You can
    usually tell from the unification rule for functions (equating the
    annotation variables in that case usually means that active measures
    against poisoning were not taken).
  * Is the flow of the case statements done well?
  * does the documentation provide the necessary type rules and explanations
  * maybe it goes without saying, but if some part is partially answered,
    you should estimate the percentage that was done correctly.
    
Bonuspoint: 
  - is there a polyvariant implementation?
  No
  - if yes, give up to one point (don't forget to run it on examples where it 
    makes a difference)

Score for:
(i)        : 3.3
(ii)       : 1.8
(iii)      : 2.2
(iv)       : 0.1
Readability: 0.5
Bonus      : 0
