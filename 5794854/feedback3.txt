To grade the type and effect systems submission, use the following:

(i)   3.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(ii)  2   points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(iii) 2.5 points or less (0.5 for examples, 0.5 for docs, rest for code)
(iv)  1   point or less
   
The code looks very good. Examples cover most of the important cases. Subeffecting works. Typing rules included. Only the polyvariant is not implemented. 
    
Bonuspoint: 
  - is there a polyvariant implementation?
  - if yes, give up to one point (don't forget to run it on examples where it 
    makes a difference)

Score for:
(i)        : 3.5
(ii)       : 2.0
(iii)      : 2.5
(iv)       : 1.0
Readability: 1.0
Bonus      : 0.0
